## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
- If no rating is selected the submit button would be disabled

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

For some reason i could not get get hiding one container and showing another simultaneously to work as I thought. hmmm

culprit found css was not working because i used 
```css
.thankyou-card-container .hide 
```
with a space between instead of this
```css
.thankyou-card-container.hide 
```
That slight difference made the code fail. 
Another logic I encountered was if no score is selected what happens. I made the button disabled.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


### Continued development

- Would love to add animations to the elements on load.
- Add jiggle animation when no score is selected on submit

### Useful resources

- [event.target.id VS event.currentTarget.id VS this.id](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32456290/event-target-id-vs-event-currenttarget-id-vs-this-id) - I wanted to know the differences between them and use cases, this thread helped.
- [Check for null in JavaScript](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-check-for-null-in-javascript-dffab64d8ed5) - I was not sure what equality to use in this instance so this article helped.
